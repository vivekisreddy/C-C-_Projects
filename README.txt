This is a basic program that checks if a number inputted by the user is a prime value 
or not. The program uses for-loop iteration to loop through all of the numbers and 
checks whether a number is prime or not. For saving and compling the 
program file I inputted cd '.\Desktop\Term C\CS_2303_Projects\Homework\Homework 0\' into
the terminal which saved it to my computer disk. Then I inputted gcc .\prime_number.c
which complied the program with GCC and then inputted and gcc -Wall filename.c to check for warnings.
Finally inputted \a.exe to run my code. 


The logic and writing of this code was entirely done by me but I have discussed with 
Jahnavi Prudhivi, and Aishwarya Silam with ideas and brainstroming. I also went to office 
hours with Proffessor Mortensen to discuss about my code and for the logic, and resolve 
any problems I had while running my program. Proffessor Mortensen has suggested me to save 
my program and complie the code properly to make sure it works accordingly.
